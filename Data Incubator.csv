Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,100,1,0,"One of the best Call of Duty of all time: Insane graphics, dynamic movement, ballistics, etc. It's a masterpiece.

Infinity Ward did really well with this one, the combat system is really well-made, a new engine that changed everything. Despite some flaws like Survival exclusive to PS4. The introductions of the new game modes, bring variety to the Multiplayer. The gun customization are insane (You can even convert your M4A1 to a deadly 9mm Submachine Gun!) help customize your play style."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,80,1,0,"I got this game to have a good time and wasnt disappointed. Pleasant gameplay, graphics and story, recommend it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,90,1,0,"There's everything in this game that one would ask from a fps let alone a cod game! It has an awesome campaign, incredible gameplay, amazing characters, stunning visuals and what not! The game is perfectly nailed and after the ending and what it revealed about the legendary Task force 141 I'm super hyped for the sequel! The multiplayer is great and incredible fun to play the gunplay itself is just epic ranging from sick reload animations to epic sights and stuff the recoil is also pretty damn perfect reloading feels better than it has felt in any fps game I mean you can even reload while ADS and it feels ultra satisfying!! This is a true call of duty game, finally after all these years cod is truly back!!! Must buy imo."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,80,1,0,"Believe the hype, the latest Modern Warfare reboot is a blast in terms of graphical fidelity, sound design, and realism that will keep you busy on the battlefield. Plus, this is by far one of the most controversial game since MW2 that will get under your skin as you play the main campaign and everything in it is great. However, it's a huge turnoff when it comes to the length of the campaign and the maps in the multiplayer side did not align well in terms of a bad spawning system and campers. Especially when the special ops even the survival mode feels unfinished and underdeveloped that could easily upset those that love to play coop with friends or strangers online. This is a technically well crafted reboot, but it desperately needs more room for improvement. But hey, it's better than the fantasy Black Ops 4 right?"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,92,1,1,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare puts the franchise back where it needs to be. You get a wonderful campaign, team-oriented spec ops, and a variety of multiplayer options that cater to those who love large and small scale warfare."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,90,1,1,"After a multiplayer-centric episode, the COD fans will be delight with the return of a nervous and strong solo campaign. Modern Warfare is back with old-fashioned gameplay that is more grounded and efficient. The generous amount of content adds some depth to one of the best chapters of the saga to date. Magic!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,90,1,1,"A great campaign, excellent multiplayer modes and amazing graphics make this game worthy of its namesake."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,90,1,1,"The Spec Op mode is challenging and I like that it gives you so many tactical options, but at times it can feel a little too much like a horde mode. Multiplayer is as solid as ever, and the new tech enabled by the new game engine brings the graphics and sounds of the game to a whole new level. Gunfight and Ground War are great new additions to the mix, and now you can easily find a mode that fits both your playstyle and the amount of time that you have available to play."
NBA 2k20,80,1,0,"NBA 2k20 I found be very similar last years game. Sure there have been a few tweaks but the overall formula has remained largely unchanged. Not that it's a bad game, it just needs some taking out and dusting iff to make it feel fresh and overly exciting again. The game is still great in the fact it does do so much right like previous years rendition. I just want to see a sports game finally come out that that you are just like wow this is definitely a 10/10. I have fond memories of the old sports games and I played them an excitement like no other, no micro-transactions or and its was just all about pure fun and putting your victories in your friends or family members faces. NBA 2k20 is light years ahead of what we use to play but that same level of fun can be appreciated and recreated today people just need to stop worrying about how they can possibly be that disappointed the the small tweaks and the basketball game they go out every year and buy, enjoy it for what it is a fun experience that is brought you you year after year and stop rating games 0.8/10. The new consoles are upon next holiday season, I think we're in for a fantastic time and I think just maybe were going to see that 9/10 or maybe even that 10/10 basketball experience. I'm super stoked too see what next year holds in store fun and new gaming experience. If you enjoyed last years offering you will have no issues enjoying NBA 2K20 either. "
NBA 2k20,80,1,0," There?s some bugs with the progress bars not going up. There?s also workarounds. 2. The loading times are atrocious. Those are the only major issues. The rest of the complaints are from exploiters who can?t adjust to having to play fairly to win. They finally got exposed with this game and the scores show it. Side note, AI in general can be dumb. I mean dog chasing its own tail levels of dumb."
NBA 2k20,10,1,0,"Everybody yelling about Casino Game is hopefully aware that this is only true for MyTeam (Ultimate Team) Mode. Just don?t play that, it has nothing to do with Basketball!! The rest is pretty much the best Game 2K has released in years, so give it a try and if you love the game of Basketball spend 100dreds of hours enjoying it!"
NBA 2k20,10,1,0,"This is a decent game, some don?t even watch basketball. This game has a major improvement from last years gameplay, most people screaming about parks must want more latency in the servers, keep in mind every one is rating off the launch to be honest it still is too early to rate this game I?ll give it a"
NBA 2k20,98,1,1,"NBA 2K20 has made it again. The title of 2K Games comes with enough new features for veterans to feel and evolution and the simplicity necessary to catch the newbies. Thus, the title par excellence of basketball stands, one more year, as one of the most complete sports games on the market."
NBA 2k20,90,1,1,"It looks beautiful, plays like butter, and is still one of the most enjoyable games I play each year. The game does have its issues, but as of writing, a lot of the glitches I saw seem to have been addressed. My biggest gripe (and I know I?m not alone) is the amount of emphasis placed on VC each year, and how it feels even more off-putting this year. It takes away from what is such a beautiful and well-crafted game. But if you?re like me and don?t play the card game and don?t mind the grind, NBA 2K20 is still the best sports game on the market."
NBA 2k20,88,1,1,"Overall, NBA 2K20 is still the best basketball game on the planet and that doesn?t look to be changing any time soon. While some fans may be upset about microtransactions, it?s not a requirement to play the game. At this point, however, it seems like as long as NBA 2K is the best game out there, microtransactions will be here to stay."
NBA 2k20,80,1,1,"NBA 2K20 doesn?t go over the edge, it doesn?t bring much novelty to the series. On the other hand, it has better defense and goes a little further as a simulation. But the micro-transactions are too strong with this one."
Madden NFL20,9,1,0,"Madden 19 to Madden 20 is biggest improvement Madden has had since Madden 25 to Madden 15. The graphics are improved, mainly do to better lighting. The gameplay feels very smooth. And the x factors and superstar abilities are a game changer. Every player in the game feels completely different, and they all feel like that specific player. The only complaint I have is Face of the Franchise is way to short, it is a fun mode, but it is not at all the career mode we have been asking for for years."
Madden NFL20,10,1,0,I swear people rate madden low don?t even play the game. It?s the best madden in a longtime. Form your own opinion don?t listen to these trolls.
Madden NFL20,8,1,0,I really like the game. The running feels like NCAA compared to last years game and the throwing mechanics feel great. The players on the field feel fast and agile which is something I really appreciate. Still not enough depth in franchise mode.
Madden NFL20,8,1,0,"This is the best Madden I've ever played gameplay wise. MUT, an over hyped career mode, and a lackadaisical Franchise mode plague the game however. However If your a player like me that only plays online head to head or play now, you'll love it."

Madden NFL20,90,1,1,Madden NFL 20 has reached an additional milestone thanks to the addition of significant new features. It remains the best American football experience.
Madden NFL20,86,1,1,"However it got here, it?s a distilled, slightly faster game that focuses on ironing out its rough spots rather than introducing anything that could cause new ones. And as much as we love the spectacle of an attempt at interactive story or the novelty of a quirky new side mode, enhancing the part people actually play could be of more long-term value."
Madden NFL20,80,1,1,"The unveiling of Superstar X-Factors had long-term fans of the series cowering, but happily they inject welcome freshness into a stalwart that had grown a tad stale. [Issue#166, p.86]"
Madden NFL20,78,1,1,"Madden NFL 20 maintains important elements of previous deliveries, but it is still an experience of contrasts with successes and specific errors that may change in the future. Despite this, it is a good football game that will keep fans entertained throughout the season."
Resident Evil 2,100,0,0,"This is the zombie game I've always hoped for. My expectations were very high, but this game exceeds. It blends the true survival horror feeling of the original games with the updated over-the-shoulder perspective of the modern games. With this and RE7 back-to-back, it looks as if Capcom is back on form. Hopefully, the success of this means we'll see an RE3 remake in a similar vein at some point in the near future. In the meantime, I'm going to get back to frantically searching for keys whilst fighting off the undead hordes."
Resident Evil 2,100,0,0,"I laughed...I cried...I experienced something that changed my life...In a nutshell, Resident Evil 2 influenced the way I will live for the rest of my life and not just in some half-assed way like any other game would. It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse. In that sense, no other game can compare, as no other game has provided an equivalent reaction on my part."
Resident Evil 2,100,0,0,One word.It's a masterclass.Capcom has done more than one outstanding job.The pure horror is back with resident evil 2 remake.You can recommend it to anyone who is interested in horror games. Nobody can pass it.The atmosphere of the game is simply breathtaking. For me a big contender for the game of the year 2019.other games that are yet to come will have a hard time keeping up with a class of resident evil 2 remake.it's more than a Masterpiece.Every Gamer should have this game in his collection.Whether you are a resident evil fan or not. It is a must have game. Everything else would be a lie if you say that it would be bad.This game was a completely new experience for me. And that was very positive.the money is definitely worth it.
Resident Evil 2,100,0,0,"Capcom pleased all players with a remake of one of the best games in the Resident Evil series. The original second part was a very eventful and intense adventure for its time. The developers were able to convey all those feelings from the 1998 game to new players in a completely remade game. It will please both those who love the original, and those who could familiarize themselves with the series from the later parts including Resident Evil 7 which ????? ????? ?? resuming the formula of the original game 1996 - a real survival in a nightmare. If you are not indifferent to the genre and series, then be sure to test your nerves in Resident Evil 2 Remake, this game really deserves your time and money."
Resident Evil 2,100,0,1,"The stunning graphics, incredible survival horror combat and wonderfully eerie setting make picking up a copy of Resident Evil 2 a no-brainer."
Resident Evil 2,100,0,1,"The silliness helps tie together Resident Evil 2?s combination of genuine terror with baroque puzzles and excessive action, making sure that it is frightening but always fun. It has always been the ethos that has made Resident Evil such an enduring survival-horror success for over twenty years. This remake captures it perfectly, but makes sure it has plenty of fresh tricks up its sleeve to ensure it has as much of an impact on the here and now."
Resident Evil 2,98,0,1,"Drawing inspiration from the simplicity of the original trilogy, the improved movement from Resident Evil 4 and the exciting, gritty realism from Resident Evil 7, the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 is the greatest genetic success to ever come out of the Umbrella Laboratories. An incredibly fresh-yet-classic experience that sets new standards on how a survival horror game should be designed in our era."
Resident Evil 2,95,0,1,"Resident Evil 2?s remake highlights just how great Capcom?s first sequel in the Resident Evil series ways, but does it in a way that makes it the most compelling entry in the series thus far. It?s smart changes merge with the classic design expertly, while its atmosphere is rich thanks to gorgeous lighting and incredible sound design. It?s a reminder of the past, but this remake would be a fine direction for the future of Resident Evil."
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,100,0,0,"I was definitely sure it would be a great game. From Software never fails. I took a few hours to play and that's what I expected. I am in heaven ! Everything is amazing.
Great atmosphere, graphics and story. You can fell the soul of previous games. I was really missing this world a lot. Finally got it.
Thank you FromSoftware once again ! You're the best in the world"
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,100,0,0,"Game of the year!!
A perfect accompaniment to the SoulsBorne series, with plenty of unique ideas of its own and some of the best combat of the generation."
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,100,0,0,"Top notch From Software release! Easily entitled for Game of the Year 2019! Sekiro is Rich it's Exciting and it's New. You can feel the soulsborne in the backbone, but everything else is stripped away and made new. Especially new movement, environmental exploration and freedom is so much fun to do and in combat it really works and gives you choices! Combat is fluid, challenging and it forces you to learn all the tricks of trade and implement your new skills in various different ways. Difficulty of the game feels similar to all soulsborne games, it's hard and sometimes feels impossible, but after trying and learning your enemies you will overcome and it's rewarding as always! Anyone looking for good action game and especially if you love soulsborne games Sekiro is your choice!"
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,90,0,0,"Sekiro is a great game with a new story and a more vibrant colorful mood compared to the other series. The game feels hard in the beginning, but when you get the hang of parrying it becomes almost 'easy'. But difficulty aside, the game is beautiful, with a lot of verticality and a sense of freedom in exploration without being a really open (/empty) world. It manages to strike a good balance overal. The only downsides for me are the lack of different weapons, no magic, no cosmetic possibilities and a protagonist whose not all that interesting or deeply developed. I love FromSoftware's games and this one is a great and new addition!"
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,100,0,1,"Though Sekiro feels impossibly hard at times, the level of euphoria you experience when delivering a death blow to a tricky boss or when you finally clear a castle grounds of all enemies is almost unparalleled."
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,95,0,1,"Untethered from the expectations that come with a Dark Souls or Bloodborne game, FromSoftware was able to create a game that maintains the studio's unique identity while allowing them to explore interesting new mechanics and ways of telling the story. Sekiro is challenging, but fair?a game with the goal of allowing the player to grow, rather than the avatar. It blends mechanics and narrative in a way that is too rare in games today, allowing for a deep level of immersion that begs for just one more clash of blades no matter how difficult the encounters get. Seeing each one to its bloody finish is well worth the trials it takes to get there."
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,90,0,1,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an exhilarating journey that demands your full attention. Taking advantage of stealth and mastering its posture-based swordplay is immensely satisfying. Meanwhile, the wonderful, expansive world is a joy to explore thanks to intriguing design and the emphasis on grappling to new heights. Sekiro often feels daunting, leaving you bloodied and broken at its feet, but overcoming each challenge it throws your way fills you with a triumphant sense of accomplishment."
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,90,0,1,"It?s a challenging journey through a weird and wondrous world that forces you to learn and master its punishing combat to succeed. However, the sweet thrill of victory keeps you pushing forward despite myriad disheartening deaths. Sekiro is one of the most difficult games I have ever played, but for those seeking adventure, exploration, and a truly realized ninja fantasy, the trek is worth the high demands."
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,90,0,0,"i've rarely witness an extension with so much new material.... there are like 50 to 100 hours more easily to play again.
Superbe extension , contenu gigantesque et tout les aspects du jeu de base sont amelior‚s, ca va grinder s‚v‚re pendant des centaines d'heures... et graphiquement sur OneX ca depote bien ( mode graphismes conseill‚ par digital foundry )"
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,8,0,0,"One very in depth game with beautiful environments and fun mechanics - especially if this is your first MH game. But, it's not perfect.

The Goods
- Every weapon changes how you experience the game
- A lot of depth in character customization (skills, gear, cosmetics)
- Decent story that keeps you engaged through the early game although I don't like the main character having no dialogue at all.
- A lot of learn and to explore ending in hours of things to do

The Bad
- Technical difficulties plague the game resulting in frustrating experience. From lack of optimization resulting from frame drops to connection issues not being able to join sessions or quest and requires multiple attempts really sours the fun. The most frustrating thing is sieges which requires groups to complete, first it can take 10-15 minutes to find a group, and then you are disconnected before the siege is complete and there is no way to rejoin.. GG.

In summary, this is a great single player game that will consume hours of your life. Don't expect much from the multiplayer and endgame."
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,100,0,0,"Iceborne expanded on MHW in a way that most games' DLC cannot come close to matching. You will tell when you play this game how much attention to detail was taken by the CapCom developers. The addition of the Seliana base along with Hoarfrost Reach adds an element to the base game that isn't necessarily missing however is appreciated to even out weapon elements, monsters, and the game world.

The customization of weapons, armor, charms, tools, decorations, and newly added Pendants all bolster the initial games offering doubling the content as well as raising the max rarity to rarity 12. This is Iceborne's most compelling strength as it adds hundreds of hours of additional gameplay for $40.

I definitely would recommend this game to anyone interested in this genre of gaming. It is the best game in its niche category. And whats better - there are no in-game micro-transactions!"
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,100,0,0,"Amazing expansion! It adds everything the game needed, now it is a complete and proper MH experience. This is one of the best if not the best MH games, don't be deceived by people who are salty that it is not on a certain system ;)"
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,,0,1,"The only ?sin? Monster Hunter World: Iceborne commits is lack of accessibility since you have to complete the story of the base game to get to the new material. However, that?s just the way expansions work, and in exchange for that mild inconvenience, you get another 20-30 hours of new content with the same high quality that generated critical acclaim for the game when it first released."
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,,0,1,"Monster Hunter World: Iceborne makes important quality of life improvements and gives fans of the game a ton of new content to master. While it would have been nice to have less repeat monsters, the expansion is still massive in scope and has more content than some full-fledged video game sequels do. Iceborne offers Monster Hunter World players their toughest challenges yet, and it should keep fans plenty busy until Capcom does decide to finally give fans a proper sequel."
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,,0,1,"Monster Hunter World: Iceborne on Xbox One is quite simply an exceptional expansion to an already exceptional game. Combined, they make one of the best games of the console generation."
Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,,0,1,"Despite it being an expansion pack, Iceborne is pretty much another game built upon the many layers of Monster Hunter: World. It adds new monsters, a new location, and new armour and weapons to customise, but Iceborne also delivers new details that are fleshed into the core title. The Clutch Claw mechanic transforms the way combat works for the base game, as well as the expansion, and the monster fights are as epic as ever. Each monster gets their own platform to shine, and Iceborne does not end with the completion of the campaign. As most Monster Hunter fans should know by now, concluding this expansions campaign is only the beginning."
